# Day 7!

**I thrive on +1/-1's! Yummmm!**

Remember to push your work at the end of today!
(_If you haven't done so, hit the Git tutorials from  [Day 3](https://github.com/cirruscollective/home/3) and [Day 4](https://github.com/cirruscollective/home/4). I find myself constantly going back to them, as I still don't have git nailed down yet._)


----
When you get stuck, remember: **Read-Search-Ask**.

1. **Read** the documentation or error
2. **Search** Google
3. **Ask** your friends for help

## Format

1\. Lecture 60 minutes (autonomous)

2\. Sprint 90 minutes(pairing)

3\. Blog 60 minutes (autonomous)

4\. Sprint 45 minutes (pairing)

5\. Algorithm practice 60 minutes (autonomous)

6\. Sprint 180 minutes (pairing)

## Lecture
[The Future of Programming](https://vimeo.com/71278954)

PS - Have you figured out how to speed up these videos yet? Hack the learning!

## Sprint
[React Tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html)

- [ ] Whatever code you find or use, work with it locally on your machine so you can push your work to GitHub later.

## Blog
[React for Stupid People](http://blog.andrewray.me/reactjs-for-stupid-people/) (This blog really helped me!)

## Algorithm Practice

+ [ ] Search and Replace

           Perform a search and replace on the sentence using the arguments provided and return the new sentence.

           First argument is the sentence to perform the search and replace on.

           Second argument is the word that you will be replacing (before).

           Third argument is what you will be replacing the second argument with (after).

           NOTE: Preserve the case of the original word when you are replacing it. For example if you mean to replace the word "Book" with the word "dog", it should be replaced as "Dog"

           Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck. Try to pair program. Write your own code.

           Here are some helpful methods:

           Array.splice()
           String.replace()
           Array.join()

## Remember!
+ **Keep track of the time**! Hard stop each section when the alloted time is up and move on to the next.
+ **Read-Search-Ask** when you get stuck and you will get stuck almost immediately!
+ **Don't be afraid to delete** your repo and start over. In fact, it is encouraged.
+ **+1 / -1**: As you work through each section, jot down one thing you really liked about the section you are working on. Jot down one thing that could be better. Go into as much detail as is needed, but not more.
+ **Push your code**: commit and push a repo containing:
  + [ ] Sprint code
  + [ ] Algorithm code
  + [ ] +1/-1 for sprint, algo, blog, lecture
  + [ ] A progress update. This can be part of your +1/-1 ie:
  > + Sprint +1: Made it all the way through. I now understand how to connect a user to a tweet. Cool! -1: It's not clear to me the relationship between requests, endpoints, and response objects.
  > + Algo +1: I got most of the way through, put in a solid hour of work. -1:Returning a value vs. logging a value
  > + Lecture +1: None.  -1: So boring. Also, how to get through 75 minutes of video in one hour? Can I build a time machine in Nodal??

**I am on Hangouts most all day. Ping me even to just talk about what you're thinking about having for lunch. Do not be shy!**
