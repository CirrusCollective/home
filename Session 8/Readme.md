# Day 8!

## Format

1\. Sprint 45 minutes(pairing)

2\. Sprint 90 minutes (pairing)

3\. Sprint 180 minutes (pairing)

4\. Sprint 240 minutes (pairing)

## Sprint 1:

  Get up and running with a local app.

### Method

  Write two computer programs:

**Program 1:**
  + [ ] Is always on and listening
  + [ ] Receives requests
  + [ ] Sends responses

**Program 2:**
  + [ ] Sends requests
  + [ ] Receives responses
  + [ ] Renders the response to the user

**Tools:**
   + [ ] React Native
   + [ ] A database
   + [ ] Xcode
   + [ ] Nodal

**Limit Scope:**
 + [ ] Implement a single API endpoint.
 + [ ] Use any schema (though not --users or --access_tokens).
 + [ ] Get up and running with a React Native app locally: web(Chrome) or mobile emulator.
 + [ ] Keep it simple.

**Tips:**

+ ALWAYS BE CUTTING SCOPE TO BE ABLE TO SHIP AT THE END OF THE ALLOTTED TIME (TOMORROW). What's the simplest app you can build?
+ Discuss and whiteboard the structure of the stack and data flow.
+ Everything in React is a component.
+ React behavior:
  1. Mounts component
  2. Makes request
  3. Receives response data
  4. Sets state of component
  5. Renders data
+ Utilize componentDidMount and setState.
+ Discuss and whiteboard the objective, scope, and structure of the app.

Thursday and Friday we will be deploying the app.
