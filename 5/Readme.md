# Day 5!

**Get yer Git!** While we have the awesome flexibility to work together remotely, we don't always get to check in and I dearly want to understand how you are experiencing each day. So, starting today, we will be cloning and pushing Git repos for each day. Plus we'll have a body of work to be proud of, even if incomplete or imperfect!

_If you haven't done so, hit the Git tutorials from days 3 and 4._

Please do reach out to me if you're struggling with Git and let's work through it together!_

1. Star this repo
2. Click fork
3. Select your account.
4. Click Clone
5. Copy the url that appears.
6. Use that url in the terminal when adding your remote
7. Do the 1+1
8. Push your work to your own repo

## Lecture

## Sprint

[Welcome to Tangle](http://worrydream.com/Tangle/)

- [ ] At the command line, start a python server from todays repo directory by entering:
      python3 -m http.server
- [ ] Open the index.html from today's repo.
- [ ] Read about [Tangle](http://worrydream.com/Tangle/)
- [ ] Implement [Getting Started](http://worrydream.com/Tangle/guide.html) by building the example in your index.html.

#### Extra Credit
- [ ] [Aparatus](aprt.us): Implement a tutorial in your index.html.

Stuff is going to be buggy and broken. You're likely to get stuck quickly. Reach out to me when that happens.

## Blog
+ [Learnable Programming - Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/)

## Algorithm Practice
+ [ ] The Longest String

      Write an algorithm that takes a string and returns the length of the longest word in that string. Your output should be a number.

      Use "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog" as a test case input string.

## Remember!
+ **Keep track of the time**! Hard stop each section when the alloted time is up and move on to the next.
+ **Reach out** when you get stuck and you will get stuck almost immediately!
+ **Don't be afraid to delete** your repo and start over. In fact, it is encouraged.
+ **+1 / -1**: As you work through each section, jot down one thing you really liked about the section you are working on. Jot down one thing that could be better. Go into as much detail as is needed, but not more.
+ **Push your code**: commit and push a repo containing:
  + [ ] Sprint code
  + [ ] Algorithm code
  + [ ] +1/-1 for sprint, algo, blog, lecture
  + [ ] A progress update. This can be part of your +1/-1 ie:
  > + Sprint +1: Made it all the way through. I now understand how to connect a user to a tweet. Cool! -1: It's not clear to me the relationship between requests, endpoints, and response objects.
  > + Algo +1: I got most of the way through, put in a solid hour of work. -1:Returning a value vs. logging a value
  > + Lecture +1: None.  -1: So boring. Also, how to get through 75 minutes of video in one hour? Can I build a time machine in Nodal??

**I am on Hangouts most all day. Ping me even to just talk about what you're thinking about having for lunch. Do not be shy!**
