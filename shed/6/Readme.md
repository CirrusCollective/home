## Lecture
[Stop Drawing Dead Fish](http://worrydream.com/#!/StopDrawingDeadFish)

PS - Have you figured out how to speed up these videos yet? Hack the learning!

## Sprint
Introduction to [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/index.html)

- [ ] First 30 minutes: Get moving with "hello world" React demo.
- [ ] Whatever code you find or use, work with it locally on your machine so you can push your work to GitHub later.
- [ ] Implement the cookie example from Day 5 using React.

#### Extra Credit
- [ ] [Aparatus](aprt.us): Spend 30 minutes building as many tutorials as you can.

Stuff is going to be buggy and broken. You're likely to get stuck quickly. Read-Search-Ask!

## Blog
+ [Inventing on Principle](http://worrydream.com/#!/InventingOnPrinciple)

## Algorithm Practice
+ [ ] Title Case a Sentence

        Return the provided string with the first letter of each word capitalized. Make sure the rest of the word is in lower case.

        For the purpose of this exercise, you should also capitalize connecting words like "the" and "of".

        titleCase("I'm a little tea pot") should return "I'm A Little Tea Pot".

## Remember!
+ **Keep track of the time**! Hard stop each section when the alloted time is up and move on to the next.
+ **Read-Search-Ask** when you get stuck and you will get stuck almost immediately!
+ **Don't be afraid to delete** your repo and start over. In fact, it is encouraged.
+ **+1 / -1**: As you work through each section, jot down one thing you really liked about the section you are working on. Jot down one thing that could be better. Go into as much detail as is needed, but not more.
+ **Push your code**: commit and push a repo containing:
  + [ ] Sprint code
  + [ ] Algorithm code
  + [ ] +1/-1 for sprint, algo, blog, lecture
  + [ ] A progress update. This can be part of your +1/-1 ie:
  > + Sprint +1: Made it all the way through. I now understand how to connect a user to a tweet. Cool! -1: It's not clear to me the relationship between requests, endpoints, and response objects.
  > + Algo +1: I got most of the way through, put in a solid hour of work. -1:Returning a value vs. logging a value
  > + Lecture +1: None.  -1: So boring. Also, how to get through 75 minutes of video in one hour? Can I build a time machine in Nodal??

**I am on Hangouts most all day. Ping me even to just talk about what you're thinking about having for lunch. Do not be shy!**
