### Algorithms
1. Reverse a string
       Have the function FirstReverse(str) take the str parameter being passed and return the string in reversed order.
2. A man, a plan, a canal: Panama!
       Write a javascript function that takes a string, and returns true if the string is the same forwards and backwards.
3. Each
       Write a function that takes two arguments, an array and a function, and invokes the passed-in function on each element in the array.
4. Adding
       Using the JavaScript language, have the function SimpleAdding(num) add up all the numbers from 1 to num. For the test cases, the parameter num will be any number from 1 to 1000.
5. The Longest String
       Write an algorithm that takes a string and returns the length of the longest word in that string. Your output should be a number.

       Use "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog" as a test case input string.
6. Title Case a Sentence
        Return the provided string with the first letter of each word capitalized. Make sure the rest of the word is in lower case.

        For the purpose of this exercise, you should also capitalize connecting words like "the" and "of".

        titleCase("I'm a little tea pot") should return "I'm A Little Tea Pot".
7. Search and Replace
       Perform a search and replace on the sentence using the arguments provided and return the new sentence.

       First argument is the sentence to perform the search and replace on.

       Second argument is the word that you will be replacing (before).

       Third argument is what you will be replacing the second argument with (after).

       NOTE: Preserve the case of the original word when you are replacing it. For example if you mean to replace the word "Book" with the word "dog", it should be replaced as "Dog"

       Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck. Try to pair program. Write your own code.

       Here are some helpful methods:

       Array.splice()
       String.replace()
       Array.join()

+ Day X : Event Listener
      Implement a function that associates a string with a function. Implement a function that invokes the associated function, when given a string that matches a string associated with that function, is passed to it.
