Sprint 1:
  Write two computer programs.

    Program 1:
    + [ ] Is always on and listening
    + [ ] Receives requests
    + [ ] Sends responses


    Program 2:
    + [ ] Sends requests
    + [ ] Receives responses
    + [ ] Renders the response to the user

    Combine the following:
     + [ ] React Native
     + [ ] A database
     + [ ] Xcode
     + [ ] Nodal

 Scope:
 + [ ] Implement a single API endpoint in Nodal. It can have any schema (without using --users --access_tokens).
 + [ ] Get up and running with a React Native app.

 Use componentDidMount and setState

 Everything in react is a component
  1. Component mounting
  2. Request
  3. Receive response data
  4. Set state
  5. Render


 index.html
 head body script
 make a request in the script tag
 render response within a p tag in the body with an id
 use getElementById to select the p tag
 assign it to a variable
 set a property of the variable (now an object)

 Sprint 2: Deploy
