# Day 1!

1. Sprint 90 minutes(pairing)
2. Lecture 60 minutes (autonomous)
3. Sprint 45 minutes (pairing)
4. Algorithm practice 60 minutes (autonomous)
5. Consume/videos/slides 60 minutes (autonomous)
6. Sprint 180 minutes (pairing)

### Important! For each section:
**One & One**: As you work, jot down one thing you really liked about the sprint/blog/algo/video. Jot down one thing that could be better.

## Sprint
#### [Nodal Part 1 - Hello Nodal!](https://nsipplswezey.github.io/2016/04/08/Nodal-JS-Part-1-Version-2.html)

##### Extra Credit

Tips:
+ Read the footnotes as you come to them.
+ Look up terms that are unfamiliar, but don't spend more than a minute down any rabbit hole.
+ Work fast, but don't expect to finish.
+ If you do finish and have everything working, move on to the extra credit.

## Lecture
#### [Nick's Nodal Talk at App Academy June 1, 2016](https://goo.gl/Bmx9u7)

## Algorithm Practice
#### Reverse a string

Create a function **firstReverse** that takes a string as a parameter and returns the string in reversed order.

## Blog
[Intro to the Nodal TL;DR](https://medium.com/@nsipplswezey/introducing-the-nodal-tl-dr-e165e0278ffb#.bci12o1f6)
+ Dive into the links.
+ If you finish ahead of time, choose and implement another TL;DR from [here](https://medium.com/@nsipplswezey).

## Remember!
+ Keep track of your time! Hard stop each section when the alloted time is up and move on to the next. That yucky feeling of not finishing is part of this!
+ Reach out when you get stuck and you will get stuck almost immediately!
+ Don't be afraid to delete your repo and start over. In fact, I encourage it.
+ Send me your algorithm solutions or send me your gitHub repo.
+ Send me your 1 & 1's or gitHub repo.
