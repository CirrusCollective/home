**Thanks for being patient! Things have been chaotic here as I'm visiting family, in the best way, but it has affected some of my duties to you.**

## Four things for today and tomorrow:
1\. Send me a note today letting me know the scope of your app and what you have been able to accomplish over the past two days.

2\. Pitch your app to someone in our class. Preferably, reach out to someone you haven't been pairing with. Cover what the client does and what the server does.

3\. Draw 3 pictures and send them to me:
+ [ ] One that captures the user's sensation of using the app
+ [ ] One that captures the views the user sees
+ [ ] One that captures how the two programs —the react native app and the nodal API server— communicate
+ [ ] Do this on a whiteboard or piece of paper, snap a pic and send it.

4\. Watch [Kevin's and Michelle's Nodal vids](https://goo.gl/Bmx9u7).

Remember: If you are behind on completing your original idea, cut the scope of the project instead of expanding the time for it. The goal is to ship something in the time allotted. Even as simple as one endpoint, one request, one response, render the data to the user, ship.

This weekend my goal is to build sprints around deployment and machine learning.
