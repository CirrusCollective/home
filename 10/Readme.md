2\. Sprint 90 minutes (pairing)

3\. Sprint 180 minutes (pairing)

4\. Sprint 240 minutes (pairing)

**Remember: If you are behind on completing your app, cut the scope of the project instead of expanding the time for it. The goal is to ship something in the time allotted. Be clear about your goal but keep redefining what you intend to ship. CUT, CUT, CUT!!**

**Even as simple as one endpoint, one request, one response, render the data to the user, ship.**
